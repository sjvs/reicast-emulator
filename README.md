reicast
===========
reicast is a multi-platform Sega Dreamcast emulator.

This is a developer-oriented resource, if you just want bins head over to http://reicast.com/

For development discussion, join #dreamcast in the r/EmuDev slack, https://slofile.com/slack/emudev

Caution
-------
The source is a mess, and I need sleep.
We had to discover some interesting arm bugs on the cleaned/refactored branch right after the release.
Expect a much improved changed folder/make structure soon.

Rebranding/forks
----------------
If you are interested into further porting/adapting/whatever, *please* don't fork off. I hate that. Really.

Let's try to keep everything under a single project :)

Donations and stuff
-------------------
Well, glad you liked the project so far!

We're currently short on hardware.

If you would like to donate some devices, get in touch at team@reicast.com.
GLES3 capable stuff, some mainstream hardware and rarities would be extremely
appreciated.
Keep in mind we're located in Greece for the most part

This has been tested/developed on
* Galaxy tab 7.0 Plus
* LG P990
* Archos 10G9
* Some Chinese tablet
* OUYA
* Various development boards
* GCW Zero

We had to buy all of these, except the GCW Zero and a BeagleBone which were
donated (Thanks! You rock!)

Apart from that, we don't accept monetary donations right now.
We also don't plan to be releasing a premium version at any store.
Most of the project has been developed by drk||Raziel (aka, skmp, drk, Raz,
etc) but it has been based on the works of multiple people. It would be
extremely unfair to charge for it and get all the credit :)

We're planning for an indiegogo campaign later on to help with sustained
development and running costs, so follow @reicastdc on twitter for updates

Special thanks

In previous iterations a lot of people have worked on this, notably David
Miller (aka, ZeZu), the nullDC team, friends from #pcsx2 and all over the world :)
